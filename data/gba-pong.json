    "A simple Pong game developed for the Game Boy Advance using C. It utilizes the mode 3, also known as bitmap mode, and features a cool pixel art title screen.",
    "Although it doesn't have any advanced features, it was a great project for me to dive into the C programming world, into dockerizing a C environment, and into game development."
