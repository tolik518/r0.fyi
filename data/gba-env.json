    "A no_std rust crate for detecting the environment/system on which the Game Boy Advance ROM is currently running ex. GBA/NDS/mGBA/VBA/gpSP.",
    "The crate was mostly a community effort. Most of the algorithms already existed in the community, but they were scattered around in different projects. I collected them, put them together, and created a crate out of them."
